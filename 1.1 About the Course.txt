In this lesson, we are going to preview the *KVM Virtualization on Linux* course.  We will talk about the scope of the course and what skills and experience you should bring.  When you finish this lesson, you should have a good understanding of the course.

#### Ratings and Feedback

Throughout the course, the lessons, and labs, as well as for the entire course itself, there are opportunities to provide feedback (thumbs up, thumbs down).  I appreciate your feedback as it helps me make *this* course better, as well as  *future* courses.  If you liked a lesson/lab/course and would like to make a suggestion, but want to also give it a "thumbs up", you can do that as well!

#### About the Course

In this course, we're going to explore *KVM Virtualization on Linux* from *four* perspectives:

1. *Workstation Virtualization* Using **CentOS 8**
  - *Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager)*
2. *Web-based Virtualization* Using **CentOS 8**
  - *Cockpit / Web Console*
3. *CLI Administration* Using **CentOS 8**
4. *Exploring* **oVirt** on **CentOS 7**

Due to the course requirement for nested virtualization, there are no hands-on labs, as there is *no support* for nested virtualization in hands-on labs.  For the same reason, this *will not work* in the Cloud Playground.  Therefore, all lessons are follow-along, using your computer(s) (optional, but recommended).

#### Course Prerequisites

**Student must be experienced / proficient with:**

- Linux:
  - Command line
  - GUI
  - Networking
  - Storage
- Exposure to RHEL distributions a plus:
  - 'dnf' / ‘yum’ - package management
- Hardware:
  - Intel (VT-x)
  - AMD (AMD-V)
- Intermediate Networking Skills
- Intermediate Storage Skills
- Virtualization Experience is a plus

**Hardware/software requirements to follow along:**

- Computer(s):
  - Intel CPU with **VT-x**
  - AMD CPU with **AMD-V**
  - Plenty of RAM
  - The more cores, the merrier
  - Reasonable disk space

- Alternative Hypervisor:
  - *Nested virtualization support*
  - Self-supported:
    - Lessons to assist with setup

**I'm using:**

- Two **Dell Precision T3500** workstations:
  - Single 6-core Xeon
  - 24GB RAM
  - RAID-1 1TB HDD
  - Two network connections:
    - "Public" Network
    - "Private" Network

***Students will need to be patient***

- Virtualization can mean installs take time:
  - Get up and stretch
  - Get a snack
  - Bio breaks
  - Review past lessons
  - Get refreshed for when the action resumes

In this course, I've aspired to provide an interesting journey through four scenarios that utilize ***KVM Virtualization on Linux***.

### *I hope you enjoy the course!*
