In this lesson, we will take a look at the Virtual Machine Manager (`virt-manager`), which is a graphical utility that we can use to manage guest virtual machines that run on QEMU/KVM hypervisors.

### Introduction to 'virt-manager'

#### What is 'virt-manager'?

From the [Virtual Machine Manager website:](https://virt-manager.org/)

"The `virt-manager` application is a desktop user interface for managing virtual machines through `libvirt`. It primarily targets KVM VMs, but also manages Xen and LXC (Linux Containers). It presents a summary view of running domains, their live performance, and resource utilization statistics. Wizards enable the creation of new domains, and configuration and adjustment of a domainâ€™s resource allocation and virtual hardware. An embedded VNC and SPICE client viewer presents a full graphical console to the guest domain."

#### Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager) functionality:

- Creates, edits, starts, and stops guest VMs
- Provides console access for guest VMs
- Provides operating metrics for guest VMs
- Displays the current status of virtualization hosts and guest VMs
- Provides a *choice of hypervisors*
- Supports LXC containers

#### How does 'virt-manager' work?

Virtual Machine Manager runs in a user space and leverages `libvirt` to access the underlying hypervisor(s).  Because of this, `virt-manager` doesn't have to know how to ***"talk to"*** each particular hypervisor, it only has to communicate with `libvirt` via the `libvirtd` service on each host.

#### Linux Distribution Support
