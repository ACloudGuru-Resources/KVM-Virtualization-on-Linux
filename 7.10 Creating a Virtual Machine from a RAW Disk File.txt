We've looked at two ways we can use `libvirt` to administer virtual machines via QEMU/KVM, Virtual Machine Manager (`virt-manager`), and Cockpit.  While these were easy to use, sometimes we need the granularity and power that command-line tools provide.  Fortunately for us, `libvirt` has a set of command-line tools to round out our toolkit.  In this lesson, we will take a look at the `virt-v2v` utility, which allows us to create a new virtual machine from a variety of source disk image files.

### Creating a Virtual Machine from a RAW Disk File

Sometimes you don't want to install a virtual machine from scratch.  Fortunately, you don't have to!

We're going to use a CentOS 7 Generic Cloud image file to stand up a new VM.

#### Download the CentOS 7 Generic Cloud Image File

1. First, we need to download the CentOS 7 Generic Cloud image file.  This file is in RAW disk format:
    ```
    curl -kL https://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.raw.tar.gz -o /tmp/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.raw.tar.gz
    ```
2. Next, we need to uncompress the file:
    ```
    cd /tmp
    ```
    ```
    tar xvzf CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.raw.tar.gz
    ```
    ```
    cd ; clear
    ```

#### Edit the CentOS 7 Generic Cloud Image File

By default, we can't log directly in to the Generic Cloud server with a username and password.  

1. We need to generate a new encrypted `root` password.  In this example, I'm using `clouduser` as my password.
    ```
    openssl passwd -1 clouduser
    ```
2. Next, we need to edit some files on the RAW disk file.  We will change the `root` password and enable SSH login as `root`.  Execute the `guestfish` utility against the RAW disk file:
    ```
    sudo guestfish --format=raw -a /tmp/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-2003.raw
    ```
    Your filename could be different, adjust as necessary.

3. Once we're inside the `guestfish` utility, execute:
    ```
    ><fs> run
    ><fs> list-filesystems
    ><fs> mount /dev/sda1 /
    ><fs> vi /etc/shadow
    ```
4.Replace the current `root` password with the encrypted password you generated above.  It's the second field in the line for `root`.  Save and quit.
    ```
    ><fs> vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```
5. Uncomment `PermitRootLogin Yes`.  Save and quit.

6. Exit `guestfish`:
    ```
    ><fs> quit
    ```

#### Import the CentOS 7 Generic Cloud Image File

1. List the current guests:
    ```
    sudo virsh list --all
    ```
2. Import the RAW disk file using `virt-v2v`:
    ```
    sudo virt-v2v -i disk /tmp/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-2003.raw -o libvirt -of qcow2 -os Virtual_Machines -n default -on centos-7-generic-cloud-vm
    ```
3. Now, let's take a look at the list of guests:
    ```
    sudo virsh list --all
    ```
4. Next, start the virtual machine:
    ```
    sudo virsh start centos-7-generic-cloud-vm
    ```

#### Connect to the Console

1. Head on over to your web browser and log in to Cockpit.  
2. Navigate to the *Virtual Machines* pane, click on your new `centos-7-generic-cloud-vm` VM, and click on the *Console* tab.  
3. Log in to the VM as `root`.
4. Let's patch the VM:
    ```
    yum -y update
    ```
5. When patching is complete, go ahead and shut the VM down.

Congratulations!  You just imported a new virtual machine from a RAW disk file!
