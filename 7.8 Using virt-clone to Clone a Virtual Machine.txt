We've looked at two ways we can use `libvirt` to administer virtual machines via QEMU/KVM, Virtual Machine Manager (`virt-manager`), and Cockpit.  While these were easy to use, sometimes we need the granularity and power that command-line tools provide.  Fortunately for us, `libvirt` has a set of command-line tools to round out our toolkit.  In this lesson, we will take a look at how to use the `virt-clone` command to clone a virtual machine.

### Using 'virt-clone' to Clone a Virtual Machine

In this lesson, we're going to clone our `centos-7-cli-vm` and patch it so we can turn it into a template to for new CentOS 7 VMs for our DBA team.

#### Clone a virtual machine

Before we clone our virtual machine, we need to shut it down.

1. Check the status of the `centos-7-cli-vm` guest:
    ```
    sudo virsh list --all
    ```
2. Shut the `centos-7-cli-vm` virtual machine down (if it is running):
    ```
    sudo virsh shutdown centos-7-cli-vm
    ```
3. Confirm that the virtual machine is shut down:
    ```
    sudo virsh list --all
    ```

#### Start the clone

We're going to clone our virtual machine so we can turn the clone into a template.  This preserves our original VM in case something goes wrong during the template phase of our work.

Clone our `centos-7-cli-vm` guest, with the clone name of `centos-7-db-template`, including *all* the virtual disks:
```
sudo virt-clone --original=centos-7-cli-vm --name=centos-7-db-template --auto-clone
```

#### Patch the cloned virtual machine

1. Start the new clone:
    ```
    sudo virsh start centos-7-db-template
    ```
2. Log in to the virtual machine using `virsh console` as `cloud_user`:
    ```
    sudo virsh console centos-7-db-template
    ```
3. Patch the VM:
    ```
    sudo yum -y update
    ```
4. When the patching is complete, log out.  Use **CTRL** + **]** to exit the `virsh` console.

#### Shut down the cloned virtual machine

1. Shut the `centos-7-db-template` virtual machine down:
    ```
    sudo virsh shutdown centos-7-db-template
    ```
2. Check the status of all guests:
    ```
    sudo virsh list --all
    ```

We now have a patched virtual machine that we can create a template from!

### In this lesson, we covered:

- Cloning a virtual machine using `virt-clone`
- Preparing the clone to be made into a template:
  - Starting the clone
  - Patching the clone
  - Shutting the clone down
