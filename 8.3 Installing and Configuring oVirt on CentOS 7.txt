Now that we have a CentOS 7 server up and running, we can get to setting up oVirt!  In this lesson, we are going to install oVirt on CentOS 7, using the command line installer.

### Installing and Configuring oVirt on CentOS 7

#### **NOTE:** Installation requires that you have both forward and reverse DNS properly configured for both your hosted engine appliance and your host!

If you would like to set up a DNS server on your CentOS 7 server, you can. Configuring a DNS server is outside the scope of this course, but it is not difficult, and I have provided some resources in the Reference Links above to get you started.

It is possible you can "fake" DNS using the `/etc/hosts` file on any machines, virtual or real, you are using in your test environment as well.  This is going to be a bit more work to maintain than a centralized DNS.

I am utilizing my pre-existing DNS and DHCP set up in my home lab environment, which runs on Linux, outside of the CentOS 7 servers I am using for these lessons.  I have forward and reverse DNS configured for the servers and the hosted engine, as well as a DHCP reservation for the hosted engine.

#### Virtualizing with oVirt and NFS

We work for a large retail/e-commerce company that is deploying a new warehouse management system.  The company wants to minimize the amount of on-site equipment in the warehouses, and the decision has been made to virtualize the warehouse management systems, using oVirt, in a centralized hosting facility.  We will be using NFS storage for this deployment, on our first host, for now.  Let's deploy our first oVirt host!

#### NFS Storage Configuration

1. Create the `kvm` group:
    ```
    sudo groupadd kvm -g 36
    ```
2. Create the `vdsm` user and assign it to the group `kvm`:
    ```
    sudo useradd vdsm -u 36 -g 36
    ```
3. Change ownership of the NFS storage directories:
    ```
    sudo chown -R 36:36 /media/ISO
    ```
    ```
    sudo chown -R 36:36 /media/VM_Store
    ```
    ```
    sudo chown -R 36:36 /media/HE_Store
    ```
    ```
    sudo chown -R 36:36 /media/Export_Store
    ```
4. Change the NFS storage directory permissions to `0755`:
    ```
    sudo chmod 0755 /media/ISO
    ```
    ```
    sudo chmod 0755 /media/VM_Store
    ```
    ```
    sudo chmod 0755 /media/HE_Store
    ```
    ```
    sudo chmod 0755 /media/Export_Store
    ```

#### Install and Deploy the oVirt Hosted Engine

***Reminder: Installation requires that you have both forward and reverse DNS properly configured for both your hosted engine appliance and your host!***

1. Enable the oVirt repository:
    ```
    sudo yum -y install https://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release43.rpm
    ```
2. Check for updates:
    ```
    sudo yum -y update
    ```
3. Reboot if you have any updates.

4. Install the self-hosted engine setup package:
    ```
    sudo yum -y install ovirt-hosted-engine-setup
    ```
5. Execute the deployment script:
    ```
    sudo hosted-engine --deploy
    ```
You will need to provide answers in your configuration script.  Most of these will be the default, but some will depend on your environment.  Note that the self-hosted engine installation is automated using Ansible.

#### Connect to the oVirt Engine Web Interface

In a web browser, navigate to `https://manager-fqdn`, replacing `manager-fqdn` with the FQDN for your oVirt hosted engine.

We now have a working oVirt installation!

### In this lesson, we covered:

- Configuring the NFS storage
- Installing and deploying the oVirt hosted engine
- Connecting to the oVirt hosted engine appliance web interface
